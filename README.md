Understanding the factors that influence health insurance premiums is crucial, even though many of these factors are beyond your control. This guide outlines the key variables that affect health insurance costs, which are used in our linear regression analysis of this dataset.
Key Variables
	• Age: The age of the primary beneficiary. Generally, insurance premiums increase with age.
	• Sex: The gender of the insurance contractor, which can influence premium costs. Categories include female and male.
	• BMI (Body Mass Index): An objective measure of body weight in relation to height, calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m²). The ideal BMI range is 18.5 to 24.9. Premiums may vary for individuals with BMI outside this range.
	• Children: The number of children or dependents covered by the health insurance policy. More dependents typically lead to higher premiums.
	• Smoker: Indicates whether the beneficiary is a smoker. Smoking status can significantly impact the cost of health insurance.
	• Region: The residential area of the beneficiary within the United States. This includes regions such as Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest. Premiums can vary based on regional healthcare costs and regulations.
By understanding these factors, you can better grasp how insurance premiums are calculated and what might influence your costs. This knowledge is also crucial for interpreting the results of our linear regression model applied to this dataset.
